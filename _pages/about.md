I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [ULTIM](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site/en/equipe-de-recherche/ultim) team at [CREATIS](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site/en), France, funded by [Inserm](https://www.inserm.fr/en/home/).

In November 2024, I obtained my Ph.D. from [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en)/[CREATIS](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site/en), France. Supervised by [Damien Garcia](https://biomecardio.com/), [Olivier Bernard](https://olivier-bernard-creatis.github.io), and [Pierre-Yves Courand](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wn-XnTAAAAAJ), my thesis focused on estimating intracardiac vector blood flow from color Dpopler echocardiography using physics-informed and physics-guided neural networks.

Previously, with sponsorship from the Malaysian government ([JPA](https://www.jpa.gov.my)), I completed my preparatory class ([ASINSA](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/node/6216)) and earned a Master's Degree in Electrical engineering at [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en) in 2018 and 2021, respectively.

Outside of work, I enjoy staying active with badminton and table tennis. I am also a food enthusiast, always eager to try new cuisines and culinary experiences.
